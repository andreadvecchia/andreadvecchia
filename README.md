## 👋 About Me
I am a **postdoctoral researcher at EPFL** working at the intersection of **machine learning and quantitative finance**.  
My research develops **scalable, mathematically rigorous algorithms** for **dynamic programming, option pricing, and stochastic control**, with applications to **hedge fund–style problems** such as signal evaluation, forecasting, and robust backtesting.  

I have 6+ years of research experience across Europe (Italy, Germany, Switzerland), with publications at **top ML venues (NeurIPS – spotlight, JMLR, AISTATS)** and collaborations with academia and industry.  

I am seeking opportunities as a **Quant Researcher / ML Researcher** in leading hedge funds and financial institutions.
