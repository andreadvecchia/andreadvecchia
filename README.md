Hello ðŸ‘‹  

My name is Andrea Della Vecchia.

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher at EPFL** â€“ [Swiss Finance Institute](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdm/college-of-management-of-technology/research/swiss-finance-institute/), working on **scalable machine learning methods for quantitative finance**.  
My recent work includes dynamic programming for stochastic control and American option pricing, as well as non-i.i.d. data (covariate shift) and time-series forecasting.

I received my **Ph.D. in Machine Learning** from the University of Genoa, advised by Prof. Lorenzo Rosasco and Ernesto De Vito.  
There, I focused on statistical learning theory and optimization, **developing efficient kernel-based algorithms** for regression and classification using random projection techniques (NystrÃ¶m method, random features).
